-Calculation of differentiated payments. To do this, the user can run the program specifying interest, number of monthly payments, and loan principal.
-Ability to calculate the same values as in the previous stage for annuity payment (principal, number of monthly payments, and monthly payment amount). The user specifies all the known parameters with command-line arguments, and one parameter will be unknown. This is the value the user wants to calculate.
-Handling of invalid parameters. It's a good idea to show an error message if the user enters invalid parameters.
